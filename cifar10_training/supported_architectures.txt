Vanila ResNet models: 
'resnet20', 'resnet56', 'resnet18', 'resnet50'

LPF ResNet models: 
'resnet20_lpf', 'resnet56_lpf', 'resnet18_lpf', 'resnet50_lpf' 

APS ResNet models: 
'resnet20_aps', 'resnet56_aps', 'resnet18_aps', 'resnet50_aps'

Depending upon the chosen blur filter size, APS models can combine APS with anti-aliasing. LPF models, on the other hand, only use anti-aliasing to improve robustness.
